# Airport Project

- As a user, I can list all flights
- As a user I can create a passenger
- As a user I can add a passenger to a flight
- As a user I should be able to show list of name & passport in a flight 

Show inheritance
show encapsulation
show abstraction 
maybe show polymorphism

want to display so it doesn't display them as objects
